## SCOPA: THE GAME OF STRATEGY, PASSION, AND DOMINATION
Welcome to Scopa, the legendary Italian card game where skill seduces, timing teases, and every victory feels better than it should. Play smart, play aggressive, and when the moment is right go for the Scopa and leave your opponents begging for another round.

This online version may entirely be coded in JavaScript: the clumsy, awkward language of the internet, but donâ€™t let that kill the mood. The game itself? Pure elegance. Unlike JavaScript, Scopa actually makes sense. So shuffle up, take control, and show your rivals who really knows how to play.
## RULES OF THE GAME
Players arrange around a table (a screen in our case), with teams opposite each other. A dealer distributes three cards to each player and places four cards face-up on the table. Players take turns capturing table cards by matching values or sums, earning points for "scopa" (sweeping the table). The game continues in rounds, with points awarded for most cards, most coins, the seven of coins, and the highest "prime" (a card value calculation). The first team to reach at least 11 points wins, with optional variants like "cappotto" or higher target scores.
